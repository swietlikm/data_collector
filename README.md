# Data collector

Script to combine results from two different measuring stations of a industrial robotic cell.
The concept is to combine two different results into one result
for a single part measured during automatic robotic cycle.
Each station is generating its own result in a .csv file
Script is generating config.ini file where it suppose to be filled
paths to the folder where machines are outputing the results.

## Features

- Monitors two measuring stations for new measurement results in their respective output folders.
- Extracts the latest measurement results from CSV files generated by the stations.
- Combines the results into a single CSV file, associating measurements from both stations.
- Supports configuration via the `config.ini` file, where paths to the output folders and other settings can be specified.
- Provides error handling for missing files, improper configurations, and connection issues.
